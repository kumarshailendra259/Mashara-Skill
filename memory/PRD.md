# Mashara Finance HRMS & Operations ERP — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Web application for company-wise, partner-wise, center-wise, project-wise tracking of investments, profit/loss, expenses & income — extended to a full HRMS/ERP with multi-role RBAC, approval workflows, attendance, payroll, stock and Play Store mobile app.

## Production Deployment
- Production URL: https://finance.masharaskills.com
- Preview is separate dev env; user clicks "Deploy" to push code from preview to prod.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + Tailwind + Shadcn UI + Recharts + Sonner toasts
- Backend: FastAPI + Motor (async MongoDB) — single monolith server.py (~5000 lines)
- DB: MongoDB
- Email: Resend (verified domain masharaskills.com)
- PWA: Service worker + manifest ready for Google Play Store via PWA Builder

## User Personas
- **Admin** — system super-admin (full access)
- **Senior Manager** — regional/multi-center oversight
- **Manager** — operational team & center management
- **Center Manager** — single-center administration (scoped data)
- **Center Staff** — self-service on PWA (attendance, leave, payroll)
- **HR** — employee lifecycle, leave, attendance policies
- **Accountant** — payments, payroll, reimbursements, GST/TDS
- **Reporting Authority** — expense + operational verification
- **Center Partner** — financial oversight of centers
- **Partner** — investor with cross-partner txn approval rights

## Implemented Features (Mar 2026)

### Phase 6 — Leave Allocation + Approval Chain Fix (Done, Mar 2026):
- **Bug fix**: Approval chains with `kind=staff` (Specific Staff) used to silently dead-end if the staff had no linked user account. Now:
  - POST/PUT `/approval-chains` validates each step at save time — rejects with helpful 400 if the chosen staff/user can't be resolved
  - Runtime resolver auto-heals broken `staff→user` linkage via email match (case-insensitive) → `staff.user_id` is auto-populated on first resolution
  - Frontend dropdown filters out staff without login + clear empty-state message
- **Leave Allocation module** (new HR Settings tab):
  - **Leave Types CRUD**: 5 defaults auto-seeded (CL, SL, PL, COMP, LWP) with annual quota / paid / carry-forward / color
  - **Bulk Allocate**: pick type + year + days + scope (all staff / by center / individual multi-select) + mode (set vs add) + audit remarks
  - **Balance Table**: per-staff per-type per-year `allocated / used / balance` with quick `Adjust` dialog (delta + remarks)
  - **Auto-deduction**: when a leave with `leave_type_id` is final-approved through its chain, `used` increments by inclusive day-count and `balance` is recomputed
  - HRMS "Apply Leave" dialog now picks a Leave Type and shows live balance hint (`x/y left`)
- New endpoints: `/api/leave-types` (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), `/api/leave-balances` (GET), `/api/leave-balances/my`, `/api/leave-balances/allocate` (POST), `/api/leave-balances/{id}` (PATCH)

### Phase 5 — Finance Visibility Gate (Done, Mar 2026):
- **Bug fix**: GET /api/auth/users no longer 500s on legacy users with RFC-6761 reserved-TLD emails (UserOut.email → plain `str`)
- **Role gating** for investments / income / expense / profit-loss / TDS / milestone income:
  - FULL ACCESS: `admin`, `partner`, `senior_manager`, `hr`, `accountant`
  - RESTRICTED (403 + nav hidden + route redirect): `manager`, `center_manager`, `center_staff`, `viewer`, `reporting_authority`, `center_partner`
- Backend: `require_finance_visible` dependency on /transactions, /batches, /batch-payments, /dashboard/{summary, milestone-income, fooding-income, settlement}, /reports/tds-register
- Frontend: `financeOnly` flag on sidebar nav items (Dashboard, Programs, Transactions, Reports, TDS Register) + `<ProtectedRoute requireFinance>` redirects to per-role landing (`/check-in` for center_staff, `/hrms` for manager/center_manager, `/pending-approvals` for viewer/reporting_authority/center_partner)
- Approval Workflows page now also configurable for `asset_purchase` and `employee_transfer` chains

### Phase 3 — Asset Management (Done, Mar 2026):
- **Asset Purchase Workflow** — 4-level approval chain (Center Manager → Senior Manager → Accountant → Admin)
- On final approve: Asset row added to `/assets` registry + offsetting expense transaction recorded
- **Asset Registry** with serial no, vendor, depreciation %, useful life, status (active/transferred/disposed/maintenance)
- **Inter-center Asset Transfer** with admin/sr-mgr decision; approval moves asset.center_id, reject keeps it
- Frontend: `/assets` page with 3 tabs (Purchase Requests / Registry / Transfers) + KPI strip

### Phase 4 — Employee Transfer (Done, Mar 2026):
- 3-level approval chain (HR → Senior Manager → Admin)
- On final approve: `staff.center_id` updated to destination
- Initiator scope: admin, hr, senior_manager, manager, center_manager
- Frontend: `/employee-transfers` page with status pills + cancel-while-pending

### Unified Approvals Inbox extended:
- `/pending-approvals` now shows 5 tabs: Transactions / Leaves / Reimbursements / **Asset Purchase** / **Employee Transfer**
- Summary block shows est_amount for assets and meaningful description fallbacks

### Phase 0 — Core (Done):
- All 11 roles defined + RBAC enforcement
- Configurable approval chains (N-level, type-scoped, center-scoped)
- Center-wise data segregation for /staff, /stock, /batches, /transactions, /dashboard
- Geo + Selfie attendance via PWA (`/check-in`)
- Leave management with multi-level chain
- Reimbursement L1 → Accountant → Pay flow
- Payroll auto-generation + payment
- HRMS (employees, attendance regularisation, leave, payroll, reimb, documents)
- Inventory/Stock with duplicate-detection
- Projects + Batches + Milestone income (complex 30/40/30 splits, TDS, recovery, assessment fee)
- Fooding Income (month-wise, partner_share split, batch-closable)
- TDS Register Q1-Q4 reports
- Bulk select/delete on all major list pages
- Partner cross-approval (associated partners can approve each other's txns)
- Forgot Password OTP flow (Resend email)
- Audit trail + Approval timeline per request
- Notification center (in-app)
- Hindi/Hinglish + English i18n
- Print buttons on all major pages
- PWA installable + Play Store ready (icons + manifest + service worker)

### Phase 1 — Quick wins (Done, Mar 2026):
- **Pending Approvals** unified inbox (all types, tabs, KPIs, approve/reject with remarks)
- **Login History page** with IP + user-agent tracking + KPI summary
- **Reporting Authority** + **Center Partner** roles added to enum (chain steps `kind: role` resolve them)
- **Auto-create user** on Center/Partner entity save:
  - 12-char random password generated
  - Email sent via Resend with credentials
  - "Login Credentials Created" modal shows password ONCE
  - Mail send audit fields persisted (`credentials_mail_sent`, `_mail_at`, `_mail_error`)
  - Re-send credentials button per entity (generates new password)
- **Entity extra fields**: GST, PAN, CIN, RegNo (company); Email/Mobile (partner); ManagerName/Email (center); ProjectType/Code/Funding (project)
- **Project Types CRUD** with admin-configurable list (auto-seeds 8 defaults)
- **Center-wise approval chains** (different approvers per center)
- **Company selection in Batch dialog** + Dashboard Company/Partner separate charts

## Notes for Future Agents
- DO NOT refactor `server.py` `compute_milestones` / `receive_batch_payment` — extremely delicate math
- DO NOT modify React hook `[]` mount patterns flagged by lint as "missing deps" — they're intentional
- ALL 3rd-party integrations go via `integration_playbook_expert_v2`
- Resend domain `masharaskills.com` is fully verified; daily quota limits apply on free tier
- Production env vars sync via `.env` files during deployment

# Mashara Finance HRMS & Operations ERP — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Web application for company-wise, partner-wise, center-wise, project-wise tracking of investments, profit/loss, expenses & income — extended to a full HRMS/ERP with multi-role RBAC, approval workflows, attendance, payroll, stock and Play Store mobile app.

## Production Deployment
- Production URL: https://finance.masharaskills.com
- Preview is separate dev env; user clicks "Deploy" to push code from preview to prod.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + Tailwind + Shadcn UI + Recharts + Sonner toasts
- Backend: FastAPI + Motor (async MongoDB) — single monolith server.py (~5000 lines)
- DB: MongoDB
- Email: Resend (verified domain masharaskills.com)
- PWA: Service worker + manifest ready for Google Play Store via PWA Builder

## User Personas
- **Admin** — system super-admin (full access)
- **Senior Manager** — regional/multi-center oversight
- **Manager** — operational team & center management
- **Center Manager** — single-center administration (scoped data)
- **Center Staff** — self-service on PWA (attendance, leave, payroll)
- **HR** — employee lifecycle, leave, attendance policies
- **Accountant** — payments, payroll, reimbursements, GST/TDS
- **Reporting Authority** — expense + operational verification
- **Center Partner** — financial oversight of centers
- **Partner** — investor with cross-partner txn approval rights

## Implemented Features (Mar 2026)

### Phase 0 — Core (Done):
- All 11 roles defined + RBAC enforcement
- Configurable approval chains (N-level, type-scoped, center-scoped)
- Center-wise data segregation for /staff, /stock, /batches, /transactions, /dashboard
- Geo + Selfie attendance via PWA (`/check-in`)
- Leave management with multi-level chain
- Reimbursement L1 → Accountant → Pay flow
- Payroll auto-generation + payment
- HRMS (employees, attendance regularisation, leave, payroll, reimb, documents)
- Inventory/Stock with duplicate-detection
- Projects + Batches + Milestone income (complex 30/40/30 splits, TDS, recovery, assessment fee)
- Fooding Income (month-wise, partner_share split, batch-closable)
- TDS Register Q1-Q4 reports
- Bulk select/delete on all major list pages
- Partner cross-approval (associated partners can approve each other's txns)
- Forgot Password OTP flow (Resend email)
- Audit trail + Approval timeline per request
- Notification center (in-app)
- Hindi/Hinglish + English i18n
- Print buttons on all major pages
- PWA installable + Play Store ready (icons + manifest + service worker)

### Phase 1 — Quick wins (Done, Mar 2026):
- **Pending Approvals** unified inbox (all types, tabs, KPIs, approve/reject with remarks)
- **Login History page** with IP + user-agent tracking + KPI summary
- **Reporting Authority** + **Center Partner** roles added to enum (chain steps `kind: role` resolve them)
- **Auto-create user** on Center/Partner entity save:
  - 12-char random password generated
  - Email sent via Resend with credentials
  - "Login Credentials Created" modal shows password ONCE
  - Mail send audit fields persisted (`credentials_mail_sent`, `_mail_at`, `_mail_error`)
  - Re-send credentials button per entity (generates new password)
- **Entity extra fields**: GST, PAN, CIN, RegNo (company); Email/Mobile (partner); ManagerName/Email (center); ProjectType/Code/Funding (project)
- **Project Types CRUD** with admin-configurable list (auto-seeds 8 defaults)
- **Center-wise approval chains** (different approvers per center)
- **Company selection in Batch dialog** + Dashboard Company/Partner separate charts

## Pending Backlog (Phased)

### Phase 2 — Role-specific Dashboards (P1, ~2 days):
- Custom widget set per role (currently mostly admin-shaped):
  - Senior Manager: Regional rankings, multi-center comparison, expense analysis
  - Center Manager: Center attendance, stock summary, asset status, batch performance
  - Accountant: Pending payments queue, payroll queue, cash flow, reimb queue
  - HR: Joiners/resignations widget, attendance compliance, leave analytics
  - Center Partner: Profitability, expense requests, revenue analysis
  - Reporting Authority: Pending verification queue, escalation cases

### Phase 3 — HR Lifecycle (P1, ~3 days):
- Recruitment pipeline (job posts → applicants → interview → offer)
- Onboarding checklist
- Employee Exit Process workflow
- Warning letters
- Performance Reviews

### Phase 4 — Asset Mgmt + Compliance (P2, ~2 days):
- Asset Management as separate module (vs current inventory):
  - Asset Purchase workflow (CM → SrMgr → Acc → Admin)
  - Asset Transfer
  - Asset Tracking (serial, depreciation)
- Compliance Auto-Alerts (PAN missing, GST expiring, document expiry)
- Announcement Broadcast module (HR push to all/center)
- Employee Transfer workflow

### Phase 5 — Extras (P3):
- Device Binding (lock attendance to first registered device)
- WhatsApp/SMS notifications (Twilio/Telegram)
- Backup Management UI
- Bulk import (CSV) for Centers/Partners/Companies
- Penny-drop bank verification (Razorpay/Cashfree)

## Notes for Future Agents
- DO NOT refactor `server.py` `compute_milestones` / `receive_batch_payment` — extremely delicate math
- DO NOT modify React hook `[]` mount patterns flagged by lint as "missing deps" — they're intentional
- ALL 3rd-party integrations go via `integration_playbook_expert_v2`
- Resend domain `masharaskills.com` is fully verified; daily quota limits apply on free tier
- Production env vars sync via `.env` files during deployment
